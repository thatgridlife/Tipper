# Tipper 

This is an iOS demo application for calculating tip and total for a bill. 

Hours Spent: 9-10 hrs

#####Stories
* Required: User can select preset tip amounts
* Required: User can view tip and total amount (tip + bill amount)
* Optional: Custom option that allows users to type in a custom percent amount 

Notes:
Spent some time trying to make the app clean/understandable/approachable. I didn't want just a pure calculator. To play with the preset options, I attached words to the percentages rather than just show percentages. Initially when the app is open it lands on the preset average. I also incorporated a custom feature. 

I tried to pay attention to some small details such as landing the user into the app with the cursor blinking in the text field already. I do the same when a user clicks custom. This way user knows that now they can type. I remove tip and total until the user starts engaging with the app and don't remove it after user has interacted with it.
