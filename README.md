# Tipper 

This is an iOS demo application for calculating tip and total for a bill. 

Hours Spent: 9-10 hrs

#####Stories
* Required: User can select preset tip amounts
* Required: User can view tip and total amount (tip + bill amount)
* Optional: Custom option that allows users to type in a custom percent amount 

#####Notes
Spent some time trying to make the app clean/understandable/approachable. I didn't want just a pure calculator. To play with the preset options, I attached words to the percentages rather than just show percentages. Initially when the app is open it lands on the preset average. I also incorporated a custom feature. 

I tried to pay attention to some small details such as landing the user into the app with the cursor blinking in the text field already. I do the same when a user clicks custom. This way the user knows that now they can type. Tip and total is hidden until the user starts engaging with the app and then isn't removed from view.
